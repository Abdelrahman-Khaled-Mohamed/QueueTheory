<h1 align = "center">Queueing Theory</h1>

**Sharing of resources and waiting in queues is a common phenomenon that occurs in every facet of our lives.<br>
The understanding and prediction of the stochastic behavior of these queues will provide a theoretical insight into the dynamics of these shared resources and how they can be designed to provide better utilization.<br>**

> **Queueing Theory** is the study of queues comes under a discipline of *Operations Research*, and is a primary methodological framework for evaluating resource performance besides simulation.

**Queueing System Components are:**
- **The input process:**
  1. **The size of arriving population (infinite and finite).**
  2. **Arriving patterns:**
     * Customers may arrive at a queueing system either in some regular pattern **(deterministic QS)** or in a totally random fashion **(stochastic QS)**.
     * If customers arrive according to some random mode, then we need to fit a probability distribution to the arriving pattern in order to render the queueing analysis mathematically feasible.
     * The parameter that we commonly use to describe the arrival process is the inter-arrival time between two customers.
  3. **Behavior of arriving customers.**
- **The system structure:**
  1. **Physical number and layout of servers.**
  2. **The system capacity.**
- **The output process:**
  1. **Queueing discipline or serving discipline.**
  2. **Service-time distribution.**
